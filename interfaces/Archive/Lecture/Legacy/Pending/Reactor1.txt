In order for an application to be reactive, the first thing it must be able to do is to produce a stream of data.

a Flux. Itâ€™s a stream which can emit 0..n elements.
a Mono, which is a stream of 0..1 elements

This looks and behaves almost exactly the same as the Flux, only this time we are limited to no more than one element.

Why Not Just Flux?

But really, knowing this cardinality is useful. This is because a few operations only make sense for one of the two types, and because it can be more expressive (imagine findOne() in a repository).

The core difference is that Reactive is a push model, whereas the Java 8 Streams are a pull model. In reactive approach. events are pushed to the subscribers as they come in.

Backpressure is when a downstream can tell an upstream to send it fewer data in order to prevent it from being overwhelmed.
